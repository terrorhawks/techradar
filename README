Big Data Technology Radar

This supports Dius computing Big Data SIG.



Pretty basic functionality, uses json and Protovis to generate SVG.

Data is provided in a radial format.

Eg. {name:'Cool Tech', r:50, t:30}
Appears in the Top Right Quadrant, in the inner most "Adopt" Sector.

Eg. {name:'Bright Shiny Toy 5', r:390, t:30}
Appears in the Top Right Quadrant, in the outer most "Hold" Sector.

Eg. {name:'Augmented Reality Tek', r:150, t:225}
Appears in the Lower Left Quadrant, in the second "Trial" Sector.

Where r = radius, and t = theta; the degrees in radians. with 0/360 degrees being the typical right hand x line rotating in an anti-clockwise direction.
